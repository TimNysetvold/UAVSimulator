function [ conflictindex ] = findConflictsWorking(distances,totaldronearray)
%This funciton returns the indexes of drones which are infringing on other
%drone's airspace. The index of the drone responsible for avoidance is returned in the
%first column; the drone that it is avoiding is returned in the second.

% each drone has is an 21-1 vector of the pattern
% [1. xposition, 2. yposition, 3. zposition,
% 4. xvel, 5. yvel, 6. zvel, 7. maxvel, 8. maxaccel
% 9. xbase, 10. ybase, 11. zbase, 12. current cruise height,
% 13. stamina, 14. type, 15. priority, 16. separation standard, 17. pause, 18. loiter]

conflictindex=[];
%Remember that in the drone vector, 12 is separation standard and 13 is priority.
%   Takes a matrix of distances between drones, analyzes by priorities to
%   determine which are infringing. Uses paremeter "infringezone" to
%   determine what's the cutoff.

% we check ONLY IF i must avoid j in any given check. j will be checked separately. 

%this function makes me cry
